1. Download the Benefits.xlxs file from the course webpage and try to load this data into R using the function `read_excel` function from the `readxl` package (rember to specify the correct path/set your working directory accordingly)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(readxl)
data <- read_excel("Contents/Material/Part D - GLMs/Benefits.xlsx")

```

2. Get a subset of the individuals that had more than 10 years of tenure and lost their job because the position was abolished.
```{r, echo = false}

data %>% subset(tenure > 10 & joblost == "position_abolished")

```

3. Further explore the dataset, make plots, summaries, check values, etc.

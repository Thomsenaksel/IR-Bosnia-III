## Exercise 1 (optional)

This exercise is for those wishing to understand stratified estimation a bit better. It is to be calculated by hand (or using R, a spreadsheet or a calculator). Note: You might have to round up or down. Consider this (very small) population:

![](pics/FourStrata.png){width=55%}

***

Each stratum has 12 units, i.e. $N = 48, N_1 = N_2 = N_3 = N_4 = 12$

And we have that:

$n_1 = 6$,
$n_2 = 4$,
$n_3 = 3$,
$n_2 = 2$,

The units drawn satisfy (for ease of computation):

$y_1 = y_{1_1} =y_{1_2} = y_{1_3} = y_{1_4} = y_{1_5}=y_{1_6} = 4$,
$y_2 = y_{2_1} =y_{2_2} = y_{2_3} = y_{2_4} = 6$,              
$y_3 = y_{3_1} =y_{3_2} = y_{3_3} = 8$,   
$y_4 = y_{4_1} =y_{4_2} = 12$.

Calculate an estimate of the population total $\hat{t}_y = \sum_{i = 1}^4 \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} d_i y_{i_j}$

***

We have that:

$d_1 = \frac{N_1}{n_1} = \frac{12}{6} = 2$, $d_2 = \frac{N_2}{n_2} = \frac{12}{4} = 3$,                                

$d_3 = \frac{N_3}{n_3} = \frac{12}{3} = 4$, $d_4 = \frac{N_4}{n_4} = \frac{12}{2} = 6$,                                  

Thus,

$\hat{t}_y = \sum_{i = 1}^4 \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} d_i y_{i_j} =$

$\sum_{j=1}^6 2 \cdot 4 + \sum_{k=1}^4 3\cdot 6 + \sum_{l = 1}^3 4 \cdot 8 + \sum_{m=1}^2 6 \cdot 12 =$

$(6 \cdot 2 \cdot 4) + (4 \cdot 3 \cdot 6) + (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 8) + (2 \cdot 6 \cdot 12) = 360$  



## Exercise 2

Use the dataset **mydata_estimation**.

Given your proportional sample from last session, calculate a direct and a calibrated estimate of the number of emnployees in 2020. Use Nr_empl_reg for calibration.

Dont' forget to check your $g_i$'s.

What is the ratio of the standard error of the proportional estimator to the standard error of the calibrated estimator?

***

**Solution to exercise 2**

First, load package survey and your data:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(survey)
```


````{r}
load(file="mydata_estimation.Rda")

load(file="mysampprop.Rda")

load(file="mysamopt.Rda")
```

***

Make them into survey objects:

```{r}
mysampprop$dwgt <- 1/mysampprop$Prob


srs.design.prop <- svydesign(ids=~1,
                        strata=~stratum,
                        weights=~dwgt,
                        fpc = ~Prob,
                        data=mysampprop)


mysampopt$dwgt <- 1/mysampopt$Prob


srs.design.opt <- svydesign(ids=~1,
                        strata=~stratum,
                        weights=~dwgt,
                        fpc = ~Prob,
                        data=mysampopt)

```

***

Direct estimate:

```{r}
(emp20.hat <- svytotal(~Nr_empl_2020, srs.design.prop))
```

***

Calibrated estimate:

```{r}
(cgoal <- c('(Intercept)'=nrow(mydata_estimation), 
            'Nr_empl_reg'=sum(mydata_estimation$Nr_empl_reg)))

cal.svyobj <- calibrate (srs.design.prop,
                         formula=~Nr_empl_reg,
                         population=cgoal)

(empl20.cal <- svytotal (~Nr_empl_2020, cal.svyobj))

```

***

```{r}

mysampprop$cw <- weights(cal.svyobj)

mysampprop$gw <- mysampprop$cw / mysampprop$dw

```

***

Check your $g_i$'s (they look OK):

```{r}

hist(mysampprop$gw, col = "red", xlim =c(0.85, 1.06))
```

***

The ratio is 

```{r}

SE(emp20.hat)/SE(empl20.cal)
```
***
**Solution to exercise 3**

Repeat exercise 2 for the optimal sample.

In which case do you gain most from calibrating (i.e. in which case - proportional or optimal - do you have the largest ratio)?

***

**Solution to ecercise 3**

We already made a survey object, so all we have to do is:


Direct estimate:

```{r}
(emp20.opt <- svytotal(~Nr_empl_2020, srs.design.opt))
```

***

Calibrated estimate:

```{r}
(cgoal <- c('(Intercept)'=nrow(mydata_estimation), 
            'Nr_empl_reg'=sum(mydata_estimation$Nr_empl_reg)))

cal.svyobj.opt <- calibrate (srs.design.opt,
                         formula=~Nr_empl_reg,
                         population=cgoal)

(empl20.cal.opt <- svytotal (~Nr_empl_2020, cal.svyobj.opt))
```

***

```{r}
mysampopt$cw <- weights(cal.svyobj.opt)

mysampopt$gw <- mysampopt$cw / mysampopt$dw
```

***

Check your $g_i$'s (they look OK):

```{r}

hist(mysampopt$gw, col = "red", xlim =c(0.98, 1.05))
```

***

The ratio is 

```{r}

SE(emp20.opt)/SE(empl20.cal.opt)
```

Since the ratio of the standard errors for the proportional sample was $3.577605$, we gained most in terms of improving the standard error from calibrating the proportional sample.


## Exercise 4

Calculate the means of Nr_empl_reg (corresponding to number of employees in 2019), Nr_empl_2020, turnover_2019 and turnover_2020.

**Hint: The function svymean(~x, my_syvobject) will give you the mean of variable x from the survey object my_svyobject)**

Which mean has changed most percentage-wise from 2019 to 2020?

***

**Solution to ecercise 4**

First the means:

```{r}

(empl19_m <- svymean(~Nr_empl_reg, srs.design.opt))

(empl20_m <- svymean(~Nr_empl_2020, srs.design.opt))

```

***

```{r}

(to19_m <- svymean(~turnover_2019, srs.design.opt))

(to20_m <- svymean(~turnover_2020, srs.design.opt))


```

***

Then the changes:


```{r}

(perc_empl <- abs(1 - empl19_m[1]/empl20_m[1])*100)

(perc_to <- abs(1 - to19_m[1]/to20_m[1])*100)

```
The average number of employees has changed more then the average turnover percentage-wise.

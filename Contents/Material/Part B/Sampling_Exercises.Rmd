**Exercise 1 (Optional)**

This exercise is for those wishing to understand stratified allocation a bit better. It is to be calculated by hand (or using R, a spreadsheet or a calculator). Note: You might have to round up or down. Consider this (very small) population:

* Let $n = 24$ 

1. Proportionally allocate a sample of size $n$. Recall that for proportional allocation, $n_h = n \cdot\frac{N_h}{\sum_{h = 1}^H N_h}$.

2. Given the standard errors $s_1 = 1, s_2 = 8, s_3  = 3, s_4 = 9$ for some variable of interest, optimally allocate a sample of size $n$. Recall that for optimal (Neyman) allocation, $n_h = n \cdot \frac{N_h s_h}{\sum_{h = 1}^H N_h s_h}$

## Exercise 2

* Using the data frame **mydata_estimation.Rda**,

1. Stratify by region and sector as in the presentation
2. Proprotionally allocate a sample of size $n = 2000$
3. Save your sample for later use

## Exercise 3

* Using the data frame **mydata_estimation.Rda**

1. Stratify by sector and number of employees $E$ in 3 size groups: 

    $E \leq 100$, 
    $100 < E \leq 500$, 
    $500 < E$
    
2. Optimally allocate a sample of size $n = 2500$
3. Correct your allocation if needed
4. Save your sample for later use

## Exercise 4

* Using the data frame **mydata_estimation.Rda**

1. Stratify by sector and region
2. Weighted proportionally allocate a sample of size $n = 3000$ by $\frac{1}{3} \cdot$ number of employees $+ \frac{2}{3} \cdot$ turnover (i.e. you need two proportional allocations and then add them using the weights $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{2}{3}$)
3. Correct your allocation if needed
4. Save your sample for later use

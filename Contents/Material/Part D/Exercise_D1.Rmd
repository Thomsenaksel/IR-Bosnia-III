## Problem 1

Create your own function to calculate the cummulative sum of a vector.
For inspiration the base R function `cumsum` works like this:

```{r}
x <- 1:10
x
cumsum(x)
```

The function should return the same.

## Problem 2

Make a function that given two inputs of numeric vectors returns the parwise mean.
E.g. the following input:

```{r}
(x <- c(1,5,9))
(y <- c(2,4,0))
```

Should return:

```{r}
c(1.5,4.5,4.5)
```
